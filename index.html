    <h2>Overview of Activity</h2>
    <p>This class activity was designed to help us explore various machine learning training methods such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. It was interactive, requiring us to engage with an AI-powered chatbot to deepen our understanding of these methods and their practical applications.</p>

    <h3>Chatbot Experience</h3>
    <p>Working with the chatbot provided real-time responses to questions about machine learning models, their training data, and their applications. The conversational AI acted as a tutor, breaking down complex concepts like the Elbow Method, clustering, and reinforcement feedback loops into easy-to-understand explanations. This enhanced the learning experience by creating a dynamic, collaborative environment.</p>

    <h3>Key Insights from the Activity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved understanding of supervised vs. unsupervised training.</li>
      <li>Hands-on exploration of algorithms like K-Means and decision trees.</li>
      <li>Recognized how repetition and iteration improve model performance.</li>
      <li>Experienced the benefits of AI-driven educational tools.</li>
    </ul>
